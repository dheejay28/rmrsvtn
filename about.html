        <h1>About the Room Reservation System</h1>
        <p>
            The Room Reservation System is designed to streamline the process of reserving rooms for various purposes, such as meetings, classes, and events. The goal is to provide a user-friendly platform that allows individuals to quickly and efficiently secure a space without the need for a lengthy signup or login process.
